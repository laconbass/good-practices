Best practices for web development, by @laconbass. This documentation stores all my thoughts about different trending topic and discussions on web development. Most of them are subjective, any developer should consider personally if agree or not each of them. Read further about each topic and make your own decissions. Note they evolve continuosly, and tomorrow anything may have changed.
