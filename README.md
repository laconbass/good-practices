Web development best practices
==============================

## Notice to the reader ##

This document stores my thoughts so most of the conclusions are subjective, althought most of them are based on articles linked here and there.

Part 1: The development process
===============================

Developing a website or web app is, essentially, developing software. The human knowledge about the software development process has evolved during the years, looking for processes that improve productivity and quality. It's important to study this evolution and conclude what we will use on our daily practices.

There are lots of articles and books to read about this topic. As a quick start and overview, [this article on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process]) and ones refererenced from it.

Reading about this topic raises to the foreground the benefits of following a *software development method*.

## The software development method ##

Choosing the right software development method depends on each project. [This presentation written by Hamid Faridani](http://www.gtislig.org/HamidFaridani_GuideToSelectingSWMethodologies_SOC_PDD_20110305.pdf) gives some clues to make such a decision.

### Dilemma ###
Light vs Heavy methodologies.

### Conclusion ###
The methodologies known as *agile methodologies*, which derive from [the agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/), seem to be th
