## Notice to the reader ##

This document stores my thoughts so most of the conclusions are subjective, althought most of them are based on articles linked here and there.

Any developer should consider personally if agree or not each conclusion written here. Read further about each topic and make your own decissions.

Ensure to read news often and evolve your best practices manual continuosly as I am trying to do here. Tomorrow something may have changed, or nothing, or everything.

## Structure of this document ##

This document has several parts which group topics and provide resources to introduce them. Each topic has a two special subsections:

- *Dilemma*: A decision that must be done. Introduces the existing solutions.
- *Conclusion*: The decision and arguments for how and why. If needed, a new option is created here, either from scratch or by merging some of the existing ones.

Part 1: The development process
===============================

Developing a website or web app is, essentially, developing software. The human knowledge about the software development process has evolved during the years, looking for processes that improve productivity and quality. It's important to study this evolution and conclude what we will use on our daily practices.

There are lots of articles and books to read about this topic. As a quick start and overview, [this article on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process]) and ones refererenced from it.

Reading about this topic raises to the foreground the benefits of following a *software development method*.

## The software development method ##
[This presentation written by Hamid Faridani](http://www.gtislig.org/HamidFaridani_GuideToSelectingSWMethodologies_SOC_PDD_20110305.pdf) introduces well the concept of *software development methodology* and the existing key methodologies. It also gives the keys to decide the methodology to be used for a concrete project.

### Dilemma ###
Choosing the right software development method depends on each project.Â 
.
Light vs Heavy methodologies.

### Conclusion ###
The methodologies known as *agile methodologies*, which derive from [the agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/), seem to be th
