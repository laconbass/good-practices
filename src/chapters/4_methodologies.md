The software development methodology
====================================

The existance of an international standard about the *software development
process* shows the needs of the industry. The entities having to do something
with a project need a common workflow to interact between them in order to
deliver the project on time, on budget. Here is where a *software development
methodology* becomes useful, if correctly applied.

### Agility vs Predictability: *Manifesto for Agile Software Development* ###

There are a number of known development methodologies whose use is more or less
extended. They can be divided in two groups, as there are two different
approaches: The traditional ones, also known as *heavy* or *predictable*, and
the newer ones, also known as *light* or *agile*. The turning point in the
approaches is the publication of [*Manifesto for Agile Software Development*
][agile] in February 2001.

The agile manifesto, in its entirety, describes the differences between the
predictable methodologies and the agile ones. In fact, it describes exactly
as the opposite, as follows:

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping
> others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
> 
> 1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
> 2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
> 3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
> 4. Responding to change over following a plan
> 
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items
> on the left more.


In a nutshell, the main difference between predictable and agile methodologies is **the adaptability to changes**.

**Conclusion**

The agile methodologies seem to better fit web development needs, specially,
for their ability to adapt to changes. The nature of a web app, and the web
itself, is to evolve continuously and this adaptability to changes is crucial.
Also the customer often does not know exactly what she want, and this implies
there will probably be changes during the development.

In addition, agile methodologies ease working close to the customer on a daily
basis, and this fact produces a valuable feedback that avoids wasting time. This
is achieved due to iteractions, where delivering often a usable product to the
customer results in that customer collaborates rather than observing the
process.

They also fit perfectly for small teams, which are the nowadays reality on the
industry, and can be easy adapted to very small teams, even to the case of a
lone freelancer and a customer.

I asked [this question on freelancing SE][freelanceSE] to get feedback about
the conclusion on the lone freelance case.

### The key existing agile methodologies  ###

There are lots of agile methodologies, but *Kanban*, *Scrum* and *XP (eXtreme
Programming)* are the ones whose use is more extended. They are proved to be
efficient at managing projects whose final result satisfies the customer more
than the average rate.

* * *

**Conclusion**

This three methodologies focus on different aspects of the process:

- **Kanban** focuses on optimizing the workflow, with 3 easy-to-apply rules.
- **Scrum** focuses on the integration of the customer as a team member and on
  the iteration process, which must deliver a usable and improvable product
  often. It also helps to show where the problems are and leads the way to
  solve them each time one appears.
- **XP** focuses on writing code itself. It raises the values and practices
  that should be considered *good*, the day-to-day working basis to be a better
  programmer.

The methodology used will depend for each project theoretically, but the fact
is that it depends more on the people on the developing team when using an agile
methodology. This includes the customer, designers and anyone who has something
to do with the project, not only the programmers.

The reason above makes the choice of the development methodology depend on the
people on the team, and its experience. *KanBan* has been reported to work
well for teams used to work with predictable methodologies by its ease, while
*Scrum* and *XP* have been reported to work well together because the first
manages the project progress while the second standardizes the day-to-day
programming practices.


Any technique from any methodology, even predictable ones, is good if it
improves the productivity and/or quality, helping to do something like:

- Definition, distribution, and prioritization of **tasks**.
- Estimation and optimization of **time**.

The previous assertion, the fact that the three proposed methodologies focus on
different aspects of the process, and the reports of them working well tothether
are the reasons to conclude that mixing Scrum, XP, and Kanban will provide
the benefits of each methodology.
