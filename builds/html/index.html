<h2><a href="#TOC"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Structure of this document</a></h2>
<p><strong>WARNING: The structure of this document is still under discussion</strong></p>
<p>At first, the concept of <em>software development process</em> is introduced. Below, each step on the process and the good practices related are explained.</p>
<p>Some good practices have an underlying <em>dilema</em>. A <em>dilema</em> is a set of solutions to the concerned problem, all considered good by the development community or by different sectors of it. <em>Dilemmas</em> are often solved through a pros and cons analysis.</p>
<p>Good practices are subjetive conclusions so there are several grades depending on how subjective they are. Each good practice has a flag which measures its grade.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Best Practice</strong>: A practice well known on the development community that has proven to be the best choice. This flag means there is a widely extended consensus about this topic on the development community.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I recommend</strong>: My criterion about a topic or <em>dilema</em> and the arguments for how and why I’ve taken this decision. This flag means there is a debate on the development community but I’ve concluded this one is the better choice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: A questionable recommendation done as from my theorycal knowledge of the addressed topic. This flag means I don’t have enough experience on the matter to flag this as <em>I recommend</em>, but an analysis brought me to conclude this is the better choice. Each <em>Conclusion</em> has an underlying dilema.</p></li>

<h1><a href="#TOC"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> The software development process or software life-cycle <em>(SDLC)</em></a></h1>
<p>Developing a website or web app is, essentially, developing software. The human knowledge about the software development process has evolved during the years, looking for processes that improve productivity and quality. It’s important to study this evolution and conclude what we will use on our daily practices.</p>
<p><strong>TALK ABOUT process = life-cycle</strong></p>
<p>This topic is too wide to be covered it depth here. The main goal of this document is describe a set of good practices for web development, not to be a theoretically reference about the development of information systems. There are lots of articles and books to read about this topic, if the reader wants to deep into it. A good quick start point, as overview, is searching for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process">“Software development process” on Wikipedia</a>, and following its references.</p>
<p>Below is a brief summary of the key concepts the reader must know to continue the reading as they are used wide along this document. They are abstract concepts, but are easy to understand.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A <em>software product</em> is an end-user software, an application which can be used to satisfy some need.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>software development process</em>, <em>software development life-cycle (SDLC)</em>, or <em>software life-cycle</em> refers to the whole process of creating or altering a <em>software product</em>. The <em>software development process</em> itself is divided into several <em>sub-processes</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>A <em>sub-process</em> or, generally speaking, <em>sub-processes</em> are the common activities performed during the development of any <em>software product</em>, the phases of the <em>software life-cycle</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>A <em>software development methodology</em> is a framework that is used to structure, plan, and control the <em>software development process</em>. In relation to <em>sub-processes</em>, is a convention on how they are arranged to develop the <em>software product</em>. This topic will be covered in depth shortly.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Important notes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This document will address the concept of <em>sub-process</em> - i.e. the <em>“analysis”</em> or <em>“design”</em> sub-processes - with different approaches, referring to a concrete development methodology or regardless it. The reader must keep an eye in the context to perform a well understanding of the meaning.</p></li>
<li><p>The international standard <a href="http://www.math.unipd.it/~tullio/IS-1/2009/Approfondimenti/ISO_12207-2008.pdf">ISO 12207:2008</a> <em>establishes a common framework for software life cycle processes, with well-defined terminology, that can be referenced by the software industry.</em> This document has been written regardless this standard so maybe it doesn’t fit with it. This ISO is a good resource to deep into the concept of <em>software life cycle</em> and the understanding of its phases.</p></li>

<section class="level1" id="sub-processes-of-the-software-development-process">
<h1><a href="#TOC"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Sub-processes of the software development process</a></h1>
<p>Let’s identify the common concepts widely used to refer the sub-processes of the software development process, abstractly speaking. The following are not perfect theoretically definitions, they are practical definitions meant to ease the reader the understanding of this document.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Planning</strong>: The action of defining the <em>objective(s)</em>. The <em>objectives</em> are the new features to be added to the software product or the changes to be commited on the existing features.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analysis</strong>: The action of defining the <em>requeriments</em> for each <em>objective</em> given. The <em>requirements</em> are the requisites that the software product <strong>must</strong> have in order to accomplish an objective.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Design</strong>: The action of determining how is going to be implemented a <em>requirement</em>. Depending on the <em>requirement</em>, this process performs several actions and produces different kind of results or, abstractly said, <em>design(s)</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation</strong>: The action of transforming a <em>design</em> into a <em>feature</em> of the software product through the writing of code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Testing, Verification or Evaluation</strong>: The action of validating an implemented <em>feature</em> and assert it meets the <em>requirements</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Release or Deploy</strong>: The action of delivering to customer the software product.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintenance</strong>: The action of fixing defects on the software product, improving its usability, or optimizing its performance.</p></li>

<h1><a href="#TOC"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> The software development methodology</a></h1>
<p>The existance of an international standard about the <em>software development process</em> shows the needs of the industry. The entities having to do something with a project need a common workflow to interact between them in order to deliver the project on time, on budget. Here is where a <em>software development methodology</em> becomes useful, if correctly applied.</p>
<p>Hamid Faridani, an expert on project management currently working for IBM, <a href="http://www.gtislig.org/HamidFaridani_GuideToSelectingSWMethodologies_SOC_PDD_20110305.pdf">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A software development methodology is a structure imposed on the development of a software product. It includes procedures, techniques, tools, and documentation aids which will help to succeed on the development process. The intent of a methodology is to formalize what is being done, making it more repeatable.</p>

<h3><a href="#TOC"><span class="header-section-number">4.0.1</span> Agility vs Predictability: <em>Manifesto for Agile Software Development</em></a></h3>
<p>There are a number of known development methodologies whose use is more or less extended. They can be divided in two groups, as there are two different approaches: The traditional ones, also known as <em>heavy</em> or <em>predictable</em>, and the newer ones, also known as <em>light</em> or <em>agile</em>. The turning point in the approaches is the publication of <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/"><em>Manifesto for Agile Software Development</em></a> in February 2001.</p>
<p>The agile manifesto, in its entirety, describes the differences between the predictable methodologies and the agile ones. In fact, it describes exactly as the opposite, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
<li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
<li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
<li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
</ol>
<p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a nutshell, the main difference between predictable and agile methodologies is <strong>the adaptability to changes</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The agile methodologies seem to better fit web development needs, specially, for their ability to adapt to changes. The nature of a web app, and the web itself, is to evolve continuously and this adaptability to changes is crucial. Also the customer often does not know exactly what she want, and this implies there will probably be changes during the development.</p>
<p>In addition, agile methodologies ease working close to the customer on a daily basis, and this fact produces a valuable feedback that avoids wasting time. This is achieved due to iteractions, where delivering often a usable product to the customer results in that customer collaborates rather than observing the process.</p>
<p>They also fit perfectly for small teams, which are the nowadays reality on the industry, and can be easy adapted to very small teams, even to the case of a lone freelancer and a customer.</p>
<p>I asked <a href="http://freelancing.stackexchange.com/questions/381/agile-methodologies-when-developing-software-as-a-freelance">this question on freelancing SE</a> to get feedback about the conclusion on the lone freelance case.</p>

<section class="level3" id="the-key-existing-agile-methodologies">
<h3><a href="#TOC"><span class="header-section-number">4.0.2</span> The key existing agile methodologies</a></h3>
<p>There are lots of agile methodologies, but <em>Kanban</em>, <em>Scrum</em> and <em>XP (eXtreme Programming)</em> are the ones whose use is more extended. They are proved to be efficient at managing projects whose final result satisfies the customer more than the average rate.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This three methodologies focus on different aspects of the process:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kanban</strong> focuses on optimizing the workflow, with 3 easy-to-apply rules.</li>
<li><strong>Scrum</strong> focuses on the integration of the customer as a team member and on the iteration process, which must deliver a usable and improvable product often. It also helps to show where the problems are and leads the way to solve them each time one appears.</li>
<li><strong>XP</strong> focuses on writing code itself. It raises the values and practices that should be considered <em>good</em>, the day-to-day working basis to be a better programmer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The methodology used will depend for each project theoretically, but the fact is that it depends more on the people on the developing team when using an agile methodology. This includes the customer, designers and anyone who has something to do with the project, not only the programmers.</p>
<p>The reason above makes the choice of the development methodology depend on the people on the team, and its experience. <em>KanBan</em> has been reported to work well for teams used to work with predictable methodologies by its ease, while <em>Scrum</em> and <em>XP</em> have been reported to work well together because the first manages the project progress while the second standardizes the day-to-day programming practices.</p>
<p>Any technique from any methodology, even predictable ones, is good if it improves the productivity and/or quality, helping to do something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition, distribution, and prioritization of <strong>tasks</strong>.</li>
<li>Estimation and optimization of <strong>time</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The previous assertion, the fact that the three proposed methodologies focus on different aspects of the process, and the reports of them working well tothether are the reasons to conclude that mixing Scrum, XP, and Kanban will provide the benefits of each methodology.</p>
