My web development best practices manual
========================================

Notice
------

This document is still on writing process but anyway its contents are free to view for anyone.
Just browse this repository, specially [src/chapters](https://github.com/laconbass/good-practices/tree/master/src/chapters).

**About the document contents:**

* This document attempts to address the topics with objectivity, but the conclusions are subjective.

* Conclusions are my personal criterion, formed after hours of self-taught reading of books and articles, and my experience and knowledge on programming.

* Any developer should consider personally if agree or not each conclusion written here. Read further about each topic and make your own decisions.

* Ensure to read news often and evolve your best practices manual continuously. Tomorrow something may have changed, or nothing, or everything.
