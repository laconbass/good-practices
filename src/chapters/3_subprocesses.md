Sub-processes of the software development process
=================================================

Let's identify the common concepts widely used to refer the sub-processes of
the software development process, abstractly speaking. The following are not
perfect theoretically definitions, they are practical definitions meant to ease
the reader the understanding of this document.

- **Planning**: The action of defining the *objective(s)*. The *objectives*
are the new features to be added to the software product or the changes to be
commited on the existing features.

- **Analysis**: The action of defining the *requeriments* for each *objective*
given. The *requirements* are the requisites that the software product **must**
have in order to accomplish an objective.

- **Design**: The action of determining how is going to be implemented a
*requirement*. Depending on the *requirement*, this process performs several
actions and produces different kind of results or, abstractly said, *design(s)*.

- **Implementation**: The action of transforming a *design* into a *feature* of
the software product through the writing of code.

- **Testing, Verification or Evaluation**: The action of validating an
implemented  *feature* and assert it meets the *requirements*.

- **Release or Deploy**: The action of delivering to customer the software
product.

- **Maintenance**: The action of fixing defects on the software product,
improving its usability, or optimizing its performance.
