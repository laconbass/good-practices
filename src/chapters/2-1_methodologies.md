The software development methodology
------------------------------------

**WARNING: this chapter abuses on links, needs more writting**

[This slide show written by Hamid Faridani](http://www.gtislig.org/HamidFaridani_GuideToSelectingSWMethodologies_SOC_PDD_20110305.pdf) introduces well the concept of *software development methodology* and some existing key methodologies. It also gives keys to decide the methodology to be used for a concrete project.

Notice the slide show presents two approaches: The traditional ones, also known as *heavy* or *predictable*, and the newer ones, also known as *light* or *agile*. The turning point in the approaches is [the agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/), the base of all agile methodologies.

[This presentation by Eugenia Bahit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8CuRtCHWD8) (ES) explains the agile manifesto principles demonstrating the differences between predictable methodologies and agile ones, and shows the key existing agile methodologies: *Scrum*, *Kanban* and *XP (eXtreme Programming)*.

Notice that the presentation puts on the table the difference between predictable and agile methodologies: **the adaptability to changes**.

### Dilemma: Predictable or Agile? ###

Should i use a predictable or an agile methodology for web development?

### Conclusion: Agile seems better fit ###

The agile methodologies seem to fit better for web development for the following reasons:

* The nature of a web app is to evolve continuously, as the web does.
* Often the full process is done by small teams, sometimes with only 1 programmer, or even 1 person.
* Often the client does not know exactly what she wants. This implies there will probably be changes during the development.
* **Working close to the client on a daily basis produces a valuable feedback that avoids wasting time.**???

### Dilema: Which is the best? Are Kanban, Scrum, or XP? Sometimes I work alone... ###

There are lots of agile methodologies, but it seems *Kanban*, *Scrum* and *XP* are the best options as they are the most used. The methodology should focus on the teamwork and be adapted to the size of the development team because sometimes I work as freelance, sometimes as a lone. What methodology should i choose? 

### Conclusion: All are good and combinable together, even for loners ###

The methodology used should depend for each project theoretically, but the fact is that it depends more on the people on the developing team when using an agile methodology. This includes the client, designers and anyone who has something to do with the project, not only the programmers.

The fact is the key existing agile methodologies focus on different aspects of the process:

- **Kanban** focuses on optimizing the workflow, with 3 easy-to-apply rules.
- **Scrum** focuses on the integrating the client as a team member and on the iteration process, which must deliver a usable and improvable product often. It also helps to show where the problems are and leads the way to solve them each time one appears.
- **XP** focuses on writing code itself. It raises the values and practices that should be considered *good*, the day-to-day working basis to be a better programmer.

Either if you work in team or alone, as freelance, an agile methodology could help. Delivering often a usable product to the client results in that client collaborates rather than observing the process, giving a valuable feedback. On the freelance case, the relation between the client and the freelance would be considered a "team", because both work together.

I asked [this question on freelancing SE](http://freelancing.stackexchange.com/questions/381/agile-methodologies-when-developing-software-as-a-freelance) to get feedback about this conclusion.

### Dilema: Should i mix all the methodologies? ###

Should I mix all the methodologies or simply pick the good things of each one? What things are the best from each methodology?

### Conclusion: Just mix the things you need from each ###

It depends on the people on the team, and its experience. *KanBan* is reported to work better for teams used to work with predictable methodologies by its ease, while *Scrum* and *XP* are reported to work well together because the first manages the project progress while the second standarizes the day-to-day programming practices.
 
Any technique from any methodology is good if it improves the productivity and/or quality, helping to do something like:

- Definition, distribution, and prioritization of **tasks**.
- Estimation and optimization of **time**.
