The software development process or software life-cycle *(SDLC)*
================================================================

Developing a website or web app is, essentially, developing software. The human
knowledge about the software development process has evolved during the years,
looking for processes that improve productivity and quality. It's important to
study this evolution and conclude what we will use on our daily practices.

**TALK ABOUT process = life-cycle**

This topic is too wide to be covered it depth here. The main goal of this
document is describe a set of good practices for web development, not to be
a theoretically reference about the development of information systems.
There are lots of articles and books to read about this topic, if the reader
wants to deep into it. A good quick start point, as overview, is searching for 
["Software development process" on Wikipedia][wsdp], and following its references.

Below is a brief summary of the key concepts
the reader must know to continue the reading as they are used wide along this
document. They are abstract concepts, but are easy to understand.

1. A *software product* is an end-user software, an application which can be
used to satisfy some need.

2. The *software development process*, *software development life-cycle
(SDLC)*, or *software life-cycle* refers to the whole process of creating or
altering a *software product*. The *software development process* itself is
divided into several *sub-processes*.

3. A *sub-process* or, generally speaking, *sub-processes* are the
common activities performed during the development of any *software product*, the
phases of the *software life-cycle*.

4. A *software development methodology* is a framework that is used to
structure, plan, and control the *software development process*. In relation
to *sub-processes*, is a convention on how they are arranged to develop the
*software product*. This topic will be covered in depth shortly.

**Important notes**:

* This document will address the concept of *sub-process* - i.e. the *"analysis"*
or *"design"* sub-processes - with different approaches, referring to a concrete
development methodology or regardless it. The reader must keep an eye in the
context to perform a well understanding of the meaning.

* The international standard
[ISO 12207:2008](http://www.math.unipd.it/~tullio/IS-1/2009/Approfondimenti/ISO_12207-2008.pdf)
*establishes a common framework for software life cycle processes, with
well-defined terminology, that can be referenced by the software industry.*
This document has been written regardless this standard so maybe it doesn't
fit with it. This ISO is a good resource to deep into the concept of *software
life cycle* and the understanding of its phases.
