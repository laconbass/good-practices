Diving into sub-processes
-------------------------


To define *requeriments*,
analysts must keep in consideration the user types and its access limits to the
app.

On web development,
*back-end* refers to the server-side code, while *front-end* refers to the
client-side code. *Full-stack* refers to the whole application code. This
sub-process transforms *designs* onto *features*.

- Copy pasted from 3_subprocesses
    - **Content design**: The action of designing the way the data will be managed.

        - **Definition and categorization of contents**: Produces *sitemap(s)*.
            - **see**
                - Semantic web - http://schema.org/
                - book: Information Architecture for the World Wide Web - O'Reilly

        - **Data model design**: Where Information Architecture matters.
            - **Conceptual design**: produces *schema(s)*?.
            - **Logic design**: The implantation of the database itself, based on *schemas*.

    - **Visual design**: The action of designing the *User Interface (UI)*. This process implies several sub-processes:

        - **Wireframing**: The action of sketching the UI.
        - **Iterations design**: The action of designing how the UI responds to the user input.
        - **Graphics design**: The action of transform the *wireframes* into a graphic design through art, the final appearance of the UI.

The proposed methodology
------------------------

As said previously on this document,

> A *software development methodology*, in relation to *sub-processes*, is a
> convention on how they are arranged to develop the *software product*.


- Mixin Scrum, XP, and Kanban
- Time management with the Pomodoro technique

* Pomodoro Technique. It helps managing tasks and enhances productivity. Also helps to estimate the time that each task consumes.

It is a time management method created by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s that helps you accomplish what you want to do by transforming time into a valuable ally. Why is it so popular? ï»¿Because it is easy to use, and most of all, because it works!
