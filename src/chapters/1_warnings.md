Goal of this document
---------------------

The main goal of this document is describe a set of good practices for web
development. This practices are not only related to the implementation, they
are related with the entire development process. This document describes both
the recommended development methodology to accomplish a whole project as the
recommended practices to use on a day-to-day basis or deal with common problems.

Notice to the reader
--------------------

This document attempts to address the topics with objectivity, but the
conclusions are subjective.

Conclusions are my personal criterion, formed after hours of self-taught
reading of books and articles, and my experience and knowledge on programming.

You should consider personally if agree or not each conclusion
written here, read further about each topic and make your own decisions.

The good practices proposed by this manual are like the conclusions described
above.

Ensure to read news often and evolve your best practices manual continuously.
Tomorrow something may have changed, or nothing, or everything.

Structure of this document
--------------------------

**WARNING: The structure of this document is still under discussion**

At first, the concept of *software development process* is introduced. Below,
each step on the process and the good practices related are explained.

Some good practices have an underlying *dilema*. A *dilema* is a set of
solutions to the concerned problem, all considered good by the development
community or by different sectors of it. *Dilemmas* are often solved through a
pros and cons analysis.

Good practices are subjetive conclusions so there are several grades depending
on how subjective they are. Each good practice has a flag which measures its
grade.

- **Best Practice**: A practice well known on the development community that
has proven to be the best choice. This flag means there is a widely extended
consensus about this topic on the development community.

- **I recommend**: My criterion about a topic or *dilema* and the arguments for
how and why I've taken this decision. This flag means there is a debate on
the development community but I've concluded this one is the better choice.

- **Conclusion**: A questionable recommendation done as from my theorycal
knowledge of the addressed topic. This flag means I don't have enough
experience on the matter to flag this as *I recommend*, but an analysis brought
me to conclude this is the better choice. Each *Conclusion* has an underlying
dilema.
